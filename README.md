# Geometric Unity (for Python)
A woefully inadequate, overly-optimistic, curiosity-fueled attempt at comprehending Eric Weinstein's Geometric Unity theory via implementation in Python.  Hold on to your butts!

## The Quest
I'm a strong admirer of work of Eric Weinstein, especially when it comes to his theory of Geometric Unity.  Admittedly, Geometric Unity goes into some concepts in mathematics which are far from my (current) level of comprehension, but I can tell that there is something deeply profound lurking within the topic(s), and I want to joyfully explore.

While I do not have a formal mathematics background, I do have 25 years worth of programming experience, so the aim is to utilize my vast warehouse of wizardry knowledge and go through Eric's paper titled "Geometric Unity", and see how far I can get converting the contents of his paper into production code while simultaneously putting the work in to comprehend the principles behind the mathematics.

I know, sounds crazy right!  It is crazy!  It's going to be a party! Wooooo!

## WTF DOES THIS... THING... MEAN!?!?!
Not gonna' lie, 99% of the symbols, terms, and concepts from Eric Weinstein's paper are WAY out there for me in my current understanding of mathematics, but that's ok... ish...  I'll get there!

I'll be using this section to document the weird shit found within the pages over time as I encounter them and attempting to comprehend them as I implement features in code.

For future readers and enthusiasts of Eric's work, I'll do my best to create a comprehension interface for the complex ideas.

It's going to get weird...
